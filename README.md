### Project Overview
This data analysis project goal is to uncover insights into the performance and trends of movies released between 2012 and 2016 years. 

By analyzing various aspects of the movie data, I aim to identify patterns, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the industry's dynamics.

### Data Sources
The dataset that I used for my analysis is [Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/movie-data2012-2016) </br>
Dataset comprises Hollywood movies released between 2012 and 2016 years including total movie budget and revenue generated by each movie. 
This dataset includes information such as movie titles, release dates, genres, directors, cast members, production budgets, and box office revenues. Analyzing this dataset provides insights into trends in the film industry during those years, such as popular genres, successful production strategies, the impact of directors and/or actors on box office revenues.
### Tools
1. Power Query - I used Power Query for Data Cleaning.
2. Excel - I used Excel for Data Analysis.
3. Pivot Tables - I used Pivot Tables for Creating Reports and Visualizations.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling errors, missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting. The Excel file after the data cleaning and with the dashboard can be found here -

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The following questions were considered while analyzing movie data:

1. Which genres generated the highest profits from 2012 to 2016?
2. Which month and year brought the highest profit? What is the best time of the year to release a movie?
3. Which movies were the most and the least profitable?
4. What were top five movies by box office revenue?
5. What were top five movies by budget?
6. Which top five actors brought the most value to the box office revenue?
7. Which top five actors were casted in the movies with highest budgets? 
 

### Results and Findings
Analysis of the results shows the following. 
Action, comedy, action/adventure, drama were among the most popular movie genres that brought the highest revenue.
In general, months of March, May, June and July were the most profitable for the years 2012 to 2016.

Best profitable movie was the horror movie **"The Devil Inside"** with the budget of $1,000,000 and box office revenue of $102,000,000. It could be a good idea to produce a horror movie, particularly if Apple TV has a limited budget for its next movie.

Family movie called **"The Oogieloves in the Big Balloon Adventure"** was the least profitable movie with the budget of $20,000,000 and the box office revenue of $1,100,000.

The most successful actress by the box office revenue was **Jennifer Lawrence** and the top actor by the movie budget was **Adam Sandler**.

### Data Visualization
There are three filters on the dashboard that filter our data - by release date, genre and movie director. There are two charts visualizing top 10 genres by box office revenue and release dates with box office revenue.
Also, we created tables showing best and least profitable movies and top five movies and actors by budget and box office revenues.

### Challenges in Analysis

One of the chalenges while working with movie data was to filter the required information in pivot tables and pivot charts. To do that, I use slicers that I connected to tables and charts. The connection was done by clicking the Slicer, then Report Connection and in the Dialog Box choosing the check box of the PivotTable in which I want the slicer to be available.
