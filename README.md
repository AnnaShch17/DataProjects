## Table of Content

### Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the performance and trends of movies from 2013 to 2016. 

By analyzing various aspects of the movie data, we seek to identify patterns, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the industry's dynamics.

### Data Sources
The dataset that I used for my analysis is [Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arpitsinghaiml/movie-data2012-2016) </br>
Hollywood movies released between 2012-2016 including total movie budget and revenue generated by each movie. 
This dataset includes information such as movie titles, release dates, genres, directors, cast members, production budgets, and box office revenues. Analyzing this dataset provides insights into trends in the film industry during those years, such as popular genres, successful production strategies, the impact of directors or actors on box office performance.
### Tools
- Power Query - I used Power Query for Data Cleaning.
- Excel - I used Excel for Data Analysis.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling errors, missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting. The Excel file after the data cleaning and with the dashboard can be found here
